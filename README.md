# SpatioTemporal.legacy

This repository was previously used for developing the spatiotemporal package. 

Development has moved to https://github.com/kaufman-lab/SpatioTemporal3. 

This repo has been archived, but you can still install the package from this repo. 
Additionally, the name has been changed to "Spatiotemporal.legacy"
in order to allow you to install it alongside the development version. If for 
some reason you need to install it with its original name, you can do so with
`remotes::install_github('/kaufman-lab/SpatioTemporal', ref = '0df042c')`.
